                This is my dog Blaise! He is a 7 year old Golden Retriever who weighs just shy of 120 pounds and is the largest Golden Retriever I have ever seen. Blaise 
                was named by my older brother after the patron saint of sore throats, although I think that was just justification for a whimsical name borne of the
                desire to have a dog with a "b" name. Prior to May of 2019, Blaise lived with his brother "Maverick" who unfortunately passed from Soft Tissue Sarcoma
                just after his 4th birthday. Since then Blaise has calmed down quite a bit and likes to sleep most of the day. He also no longer competes to eat faster
                than his brother to steal his food and inevitably throw up because he ate too quickly. Blaise understands commands but chooses not to listen to them
                unless food or treats are offered, but trick him too much and he'll stop listening until you start giving him food when offered again. Blaise is big and
                warm but hates to be coddled making him a wasted space heater in the Winter. Despite his lack of perceived brainpower, Blaise is a very intelligent dog
                who is very charming and I am very happy to have spent as much time caring and raising that dog as I have.
