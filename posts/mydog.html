    This is my dog Blaise! He is a 7 year old Golden Retriever who weighs just shy of 120 pounds and is the largest Golden Retriever I have ever seen. Blaise<br> 
    was named by my older brother after the patron saint of sore throats, although I think that was just justification for a whimsical name borne of the<br>
    desire to have a dog with a "b" name. Prior to May of 2019, Blaise lived with his brother "Maverick" who unfortunately passed from Soft Tissue Sarcoma<br>
    just after his 4th birthday. Since then Blaise has calmed down quite a bit and likes to sleep most of the day. He also no longer competes to eat faster<br>
    than his brother to steal his food and inevitably throw up because he ate too quickly. Blaise understands commands but chooses not to listen to them<br>
    unless food or treats are offered, but trick him too much and he'll stop listening until you start giving him food when offered again. Blaise is big and<br>
    warm but hates to be coddled making him a wasted space heater in the Winter. Despite his lack of perceived brainpower, Blaise is a very intelligent dog<br>
    who is very charming and I am very happy to have spent as much time caring and raising that dog as I have.<br>
