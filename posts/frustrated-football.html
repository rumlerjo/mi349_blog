            I've been an avid Michigan State sports fan essentially since birth. I grew up in the Lansing area and had great sports
            to watch as the Dantonio era of football redefined Michigan State as a program, and Izzo continued to put out fantastic
            products on the basketball court. The point I'm trying to make is that I should really realize that our program will
            in truth always be frustrating and up and down. Frankly we aren't a dynasty school in Football and probably never will
            be, but after last year I was really starting to get some hope for what the future and product that would be shown to
            myself and the new fans that seemingly popped out of nowhere to fill the stadium in our first season back from covid.
            So this year really rubbed me the wrong way. I wanted to see improvements in the secondary and an offense that relied
            on its proven tools to move the ball with a hopefully better coached and better conditioned O-Line. None of that has
            happened. I don't know what the issue has been whether it be coaching or the players not learning the scheme but we
            have generally looked lost all over the field. After a narrow win yesterday against a bluntly mediocre Wisconsin team,
            I'm just left wondering where the defensive adjustments that were made were earlier in the season. Why we couldn't have
            been running a 4-3 man coverage centered scheme rather than a soft zone earlier in the season. Where Payton Thorne was
            for our last 4 games. Frankly I've been left with more questions than answers more often than I would like, and I hope
            going forward there is major change and we don't continue to have decommitments from an otherwise impressive recruiting
            trail. I suppose only time will tell, but right now it just feels very similar to Derrick Henry throwing away my hopes
            and dreams for the program on 12/31/2015.
