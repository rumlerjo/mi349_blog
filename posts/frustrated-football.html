            I've been an avid Michigan State sports fan essentially since birth. I grew up in the Lansing area and had great sports<br>
            to watch as the Dantonio era of football redefined Michigan State as a program, and Izzo continued to put out fantastic<br>
            products on the basketball court. The point I'm trying to make is that I should really realize that our program will<br>
            in truth always be frustrating and up and down. Frankly we aren't a dynasty school in Football and probably never will<br>
            be, but after last year I was really starting to get some hope for what the future and product that would be shown to<br>
            myself and the new fans that seemingly popped out of nowhere to fill the stadium in our first season back from covid.<br>
            So this year really rubbed me the wrong way. I wanted to see improvements in the secondary and an offense that relied<br>
            on its proven tools to move the ball with a hopefully better coached and better conditioned O-Line. None of that has<br>
            happened. I don't know what the issue has been whether it be coaching or the players not learning the scheme but we<br>
            have generally looked lost all over the field. After a narrow win yesterday against a bluntly mediocre Wisconsin team,<br>
            I'm just left wondering where the defensive adjustments that were made were earlier in the season. Why we couldn't have<br>
            been running a 4-3 man coverage centered scheme rather than a soft zone earlier in the season. Where Payton Thorne was<br>
            for our last 4 games. Frankly I've been left with more questions than answers more often than I would like, and I hope<br>
            going forward there is major change and we don't continue to have decommitments from an otherwise impressive recruiting<br>
            trail. I suppose only time will tell, but right now it just feels very similar to Derrick Henry throwing away my hopes<br>
            and dreams for the program on 12/31/2015.
